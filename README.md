# data-science

* Data Science: reproducible experimentation and investigation of unknown mapping functions between data, features and target variables.
* Data Engineering: transformation, transportation and persisting of large datasets for use by machine learning and artificial intelligence systems.
* Machine Learning: empirical inductive reasoning upon large datasets.
* Artificial Intelligence: computer systems mimicking cognitive behaviours found in humans and other animals.
* Devops: managing developer environments, versioning, deployment of applications.
* Sysadmin: maintaining and monitoring systems in production.

# This Project
This project documents and demonstrates data science and engineering as a collection of problems and algorithms for finding solutions to these problems. Various technologies and techniques are exhibited to attempt to capture the broad variety of approaches used to find solutions, maximising the value of available data.
